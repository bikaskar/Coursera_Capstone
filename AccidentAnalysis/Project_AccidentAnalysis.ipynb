In this capstone we will also try to predict the probability of the accident which can be avoided people travelling on the road.\n",

In this the most important one is the security code which is what we have to predict Based on other attributes . Some of the attributes which we Can use our location of the accident, lighting conditions, road conditions, Weather conditions, speed of the vehicle etc \n",
